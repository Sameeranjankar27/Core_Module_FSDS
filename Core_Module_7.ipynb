        "A machine learning pipeline is simply a set of steps that you follow while working on your project. This could include things like organizing your data, training models, and deploying them to make predictions. Pipelining is important because it helps you organize your workflows and makes your process faster\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, suppose you want to use machine learning to predict and prevent customer churn. Your pipeline might look something like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "i) Organize your customer data. This could involve things like accessing customer data from Salesforce, cleaning it, and pre-processing it in a way that can be used by your machine learning models.\n",
        "ii) Train your models. This step involves using your data to train one or more machine learning models, which, in this case, could be used to predict customer churn. A lot of computing power is needed, typically provided by platforms like AWS and Azure.\n",
        "iii) Evaluate your models. Once you've trained your models, it's important to evaluate their performance to see how well they are actually doing. This will help you fine-tune your models and make sure they are as effective as possible.\n",
        "iv) Deploy your models. After you've evaluated and fine-tuned your models, you can deploy them in production so they can start making predictions (in this case, predictions about customer churn).\n",

You’ll also need a streaming platform (Kafka is a popular choice, but there are others on the market) to build the streaming data pipeline. In addition, you’ll also need a NoSQL database (many people use HBase, but you have a variety of choices available).\n",
        "\n",
        "Before building the streaming data pipeline, you’ll need to transform, cleanse, validate, and write the data to make sure that it’s in the right format and that it’s useful. To build the streaming data pipeline, you’ll initialize the in-memory framework. Then, you’ll initialize the streaming context.\n",
